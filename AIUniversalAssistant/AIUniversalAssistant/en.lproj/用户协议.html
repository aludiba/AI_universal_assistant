        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>II. Subscription and Purchase Services</h2>

            <h3>1. Subscription Service</h3>
            <p>This application provides subscription types such as weekly membership, monthly membership, annual membership, and lifetime membership. The subscription service adopts an automatic renewal mechanism. Within 24 hours before the subscription expires, the system will automatically charge from your Apple ID account. You can cancel automatic renewal at any time in iPhone Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>

            <h3>2. Subscription Gift</h3>
            <p>When you first subscribe to any membership plan, you will receive a one-time gift of 500,000 words word pack for AI creation services. The gifted word pack is combined with VIP gifted words.</p>

            <h3>3. Word Pack Service</h3>
            <p>This application provides various word packs such as 500,000 words, 2,000,000 words, and 6,000,000 words. The word pack is valid for 90 days, calculated from the time of successful purchase. Each time you use the AI writing function, the word consumption = input text word count + generated text word count. Consumption order: VIP gifted words are consumed first, followed by purchased word packs.</p>

            <h3>4. Word Count Statistics Rules</h3>
            <p>One Chinese character, English letter, number, punctuation or space counts as 1 word.</p>

            <h3>5. Refund Policy</h3>
